# Reponsive-Web-Design-Tech-Doc-Practice

This is certification project 3 of 5 in the Responsive Web Design certification offered by freecodecamp.

In this project I was tasked to create a technical document page. It gave me an example webpage to base off of and the freedom to choose topic and style with few restraints. Only a few requirements were needed, but include most of what has been previously learned. This is a culmination of my work so far, and I have dedicated this technical document to some responsive web design principles.
